Best parameters to a triangular function

* using a multi layer perceptron feed-forward backpropagation with sigmoid activation function.
	- doesn't work, do you need of the differentiation of the activation function

* using Kohonen Map with the algorithm winner-take all, to discover function format using pr√©-discovered data
	- doesn't work to this prupose, create good clusters, but don't discover the function shape

* using interpolation algorithms
